The implementation of YOLO models, especially the latest versions, is built using the PyTorch library. This includes both the architecture definition and the training process.

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is widely used for deep learning applications due to its flexibility and ease of use.
